The **Divvy Trips Q1 2019 Dataset** provides detailed information about **365,069 trips** recorded between January and March 2019. It captures key aspects of Chicago’s bike-sharing program, including trip details, user demographics, and station usage.

### Key Features:
- **Trip Information**: Includes trip ID, start and end times, trip duration, and bike ID.
- **Station Details**: Provides the start and end station names and IDs.
- **User Demographics**: Contains user type (Subscriber or Customer), gender, and birth year.

### Data Highlights:
- **Trip Patterns**: The dataset enables analyses of usage trends, station popularity, and trip durations.
- **User Insights**: Demographic information (gender and birth year) allows for user profile studies, though some data is missing:
  - **Gender**: Missing for **19,711 trips** (~5.4%).
  - **Birthyear**: Missing for **18,023 trips** (~4.9%).

### Use Cases:
This dataset is ideal for exploring:
- User behavior trends across seasons.
- Station and bike usage patterns.
- Demographic characteristics of riders.

The dataset’s completeness in trip-level details ensures robust analysis of operational aspects, while missing demographic data may slightly limit user-specific insights.
