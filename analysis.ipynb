    "**Key Trends and Findings**:  \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Trip Usage Patterns**:  \n",
    "   - **Gender Disparity**: Male riders significantly outnumber female riders, indicating a potential gender gap in Divvy bike usage. This finding could inform targeted initiatives to encourage more diverse participation.  \n",
    "   - **User Type Distribution**: Subscribers dominate the usage of Divvy bikes, comprising the overwhelming majority of trips. This emphasizes the system's reliance on regular users rather than casual customers.  \n",
    "   - **Trip Duration by User Type and Gender**:  \n",
    "     - Customers (who hold one-day passes) tend to take longer trips (average of 36 minutes) compared to subscribers (average of 12 minutes), suggesting that casual users may use bikes for leisure or longer excursions.  \n",
    "     - Female users have a slightly higher average trip duration (15 minutes) compared to male users (14 minutes), though the difference is minimal.  \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Temporal Trends**:  \n",
    "   - **Day of the Week**: Peak usage occurs on weekdays, especially on Thursday and Friday, correlating with commuter traffic. Weekends see a noticeable decline, reflecting reduced demand for commuting purposes.  \n",
    "   - **Peak Hours**: Usage spikes significantly during morning (8 AM) and evening (5 PM) rush hours, underscoring the role of Divvy bikes in urban commuting. Minimal usage is observed during late-night hours (12 AM to 5 AM).  \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **User Demographics**:  \n",
    "   - The largest age group of users is in their early 30s, with a sharp decline in usage as age increases beyond 40. Few users are observed in the 60+ age group. This right-skewed distribution highlights a stronger preference for Divvy bikes among younger demographics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Popular Stations and Routes**:  \n",
    "   - **Start and End Stations**: Clinton St & Washington Blvd is the most popular starting and ending location, followed by Clinton St & Madison St and Canal St & Adams St. These stations' central locations indicate their importance in facilitating urban commutes.  \n",
    "   - **Most Popular Routes**: Routes connecting major business and commuter hubs, such as Michigan Ave & Washington St to Clinton St & Washington Blvd, are highly utilized. This highlights the efficiency of Divvy bikes in supporting short downtown trips.  \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Underutilized Stations and Routes**:  \n",
    "   - **Start and End Stations**: State St & 76th St is the least popular starting station, followed by Kostner Ave & Lake St and South Chicago Ave & Elliot Ave. Similarly, Halsted St & 69th St is the least popular ending station, with Phillips Ave & 79th St and State St & 76th St also recording low usage. These stations are situated away from central areas, possibly contributing to their underutilization.  \n",
    "   - **Least Popular Routes**: Routes such as Keystone Ave & Fullerton Ave to Central Park Ave & North Ave and Larrabee St & Kingsbury St to Pine Grove Ave & Irving Park Rd see minimal traffic. These routes, connecting less frequented areas, indicate lower demand or limited appeal for users compared to busier urban routes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Bike Utilization**:  \n",
    "   - The top 10 bikes in the fleet each recorded over 200 trips, showcasing their heavy usage and reliability. This suggests that a subset of the fleet is consistently utilized more than others.  \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Age and Trip Duration Relationship**:  \n",
    "   - There is no strong correlation between user age and trip duration. Most trips last between 0 and 60 minutes regardless of age. The red horizontal line at 10 minutes represents a potential average duration, but the lack of a clear trend indicates that trip duration is largely independent of user age.  \n"

    "**Overview:**\n",
    "We applied **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to the dataset, focusing on the following features: `tripduration`, `start_hour`, and `age`. PCA was used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset to 2 principal components (PC1 and PC2) while preserving as much of the data’s variance as possible. We then visualized the results in a 2D scatter plot, which shows the distribution of the data in the space of the first two principal components."

    "**Explained Variance:**\n",
    "The explained variance ratio for the first two principal components is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PC1** explains **36.34%** of the total variance in the data.\n",
    "- **PC2** explains **33.92%** of the total variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these two components capture **70.26%** of the total variance, meaning that most of the information in the original data is retained by just these two components. This makes the 2D visualization an effective representation of the data without significant loss of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scatter Plot Analysis:**\n",
    "The scatter plot visualizes the data points based on the first two principal components (PC1 and PC2), which represent the most significant axes of variation in the dataset. The following observations can be made:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clusters**: The data points appear to group into distinct clusters, which may correspond to different patterns in trip behavior, such as variations in trip duration or age-related patterns. These clusters indicate that trips with similar characteristics tend to form natural groupings in the PCA-reduced space.\n",
    "- **Separation along Axes**: The x-axis represents **PC1**, which explains the largest portion of variance in the data, while the y-axis represents **PC2**, explaining the second-largest portion of variance. The spread of the points along these axes suggests that the key features driving the variability in the dataset are **tripduration**, **start_hour**, and **age**.\n",
    "- **Clusters (if applicable)**: If clustering was performed (e.g., K-means), the points might be color-coded according to the assigned clusters. This allows for an easy interpretation of how the clusters relate to the principal components and whether distinct patterns or groups exist within the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insights:**\n",
    "- **Dimensionality Reduction**: By reducing the dimensionality from multiple features (such as `tripduration`, `start_hour`, `age`) to just two principal components, we can effectively summarize the key patterns in the data.\n",
    "- **Data Patterns**: The 2D scatter plot makes it easier to identify relationships between different features and groups. For example, if trip duration (`tripduration`) is positively correlated with PC1, and age (`age`) is correlated with PC2, we can infer that trips with longer durations might be associated with older users, or that time of day (represented by `start_hour`) could have an effect on trip behavior.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "The results of the PCA suggest that **PC1 and PC2** capture most of the important variation in the data (over 70%), and the visualization helps to identify potential clusters and underlying relationships in the data. The PCA technique is a useful tool for dimensionality reduction and pattern identification in complex datasets like this one, providing valuable insights into trip behavior without losing significant amounts of information.\n"

    "1. **Targeted Promotions:**\n",
    "   - **Q1 and Q4:** Introduce promotional campaigns, discounts, or bundled offers to encourage ridership during these low-demand periods.\n",
    "   - Consider partnerships with holiday events in Q4 to attract more users.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Capacity Management:**\n",
    "   - **Q3:** Ensure adequate resources, such as more vehicles or extended service hours, to accommodate the increased demand during peak months.\n",
    "   - **Q1:** Optimize operations to reduce costs during months with lower ridership.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data-Driven Planning:**\n",
    "   - Analyze additional factors (e.g., weather, special events) to refine service strategies.\n",
    "   - Investigate the reasons for the sharp increase in ridership in March and Q3, and replicate those strategies in other months.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Customer Engagement:**\n",
    "   - Conduct surveys to understand customer needs during low-demand periods and address any barriers to ridership, such as weather, convenience, or pricing concerns."
